<p>
冷暖那可休<br/>
Will seasons cease to change?<br/>
回頭多少個秋<br/>
Look back…how many autumns have passed?<br/>
尋遍了卻偏失去<br/>
Searched everywhere, but still lost<br/>
未盼卻在手<br/>
Grasped in hand, is not what's sought
</p>

<p>
我得到沒有<br/>
I have nothing left<br/>
沒法解釋得失錯漏<br/>
Can't explain the gain, loss, wrong or carelessness<br/>
剛剛聽到望到, 便更改<br/>
When I hear and see, it recedes<br/>
不知那裡追究<br/>
Unsure of where to go and what to seek
</p>

<p>
一生何求<br/>
One life's wish<br/>
常判決放棄與擁有<br/>
Often faced with what to keep and what to cede<br/>
耗盡我這一生<br/>
My whole life depleted<br/>
觸不到已跑開<br/>
Can't grasp what has fleeted
</p>

<p>
一生何求<br/>
One life's wish<br/>
迷惘裡永遠看不透<br/>
When confused, will never see through<br/>
沒料到我所失的<br/>
Would not have thought, that what I had lost<br/>
竟已是我的所有<br/>
Was all that I had
</p>

<p><em>(Repeat above)</em></p>

<p>
一生何求<br/>
One life's wish<br/>
曾妥協也試過苦鬥<br/>
Having compromised and having struggled<br/>
夢內每點繽紛<br/>
In a dream, each point sparkles<br/>
一消散那可收<br/>
But once it fades, what can be saved?
</p>

<p>
一生何求<br/>
One life's wish<br/>
誰計較讚美與詛咒<br/>
Care not for praise or curses<br/>
沒料到我所失的<br/>
Would not have thought, that what I had lost<br/>
竟已是我的所有<br/>
Was all that I had
